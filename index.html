    <div>
    <h2>What is PWA?</h2>
    <p>
      Progressive Web Apps provide reliable, fast, and engaging native like experience but are delivered through the web.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Why build Apps on Web?</h2>
    <p>
      Web is the biggest plate form in the world. Over 5 billian devices connect to it.<br/><br/>
      Web can easily reach more individuals comparing with Apps. An average user install ZERO app per month, but could visit over 100 websites a month.<br/><br/>
      However people just pass by those sites. Mobile users spend more time on native apps instead as they are more engaging.<br/><br/>
      Combining the best of both world, we get Progressive Web App.<br/>
    </p>

    <h2>3 Steps to turn your website into a PWA</h2>
      <h3>Web App Manifest File</h3>
      <p>
        A manifest is a json file that collect all the info about your applicatoin  into a json file.<br/><br/>

      </p>

      <h3>Service Worker</h3>
      <img src="./images/sw-lifecycle.png"/>
      <p>
        A service worker is a client side programmable proxy written in Javascript btwn your app and outside world.<br/><br/>
        A service worker responds to network request and cached data as programmed.<br/><br/>
        It allows PWA to be instant loading, and able to work in low data-connection and even offline environment.<br/>
      </p>

      <h3>HTTPS</h3>
      <p>
        Progressive Web Apps requires to be served over a secure connection, unless its served from localhost for the ease of the development.<br/>
      </p>

    <h2>App Shell</h2>
    <p>
      App shell Is the static part of UI. the part of the UI remains the same regardless of the data.
      It ensures reliably good performance as it's loaded from the pre-cache.<br/><br/>
      App Shell architecture separates the core application infrastructure and UI from the data.
      So for each subsequent fetch, WPA only need to load necessary data.<br/>
    </p>

    <h2>WPA Features and Support</h2>
    <p>
      The power of WPA comes from broswer support. <br/><br/>
      The progressive thing about PWA is that it can be viewed as an extra layer of enhancement. If a browser doesnâ€™t support it, it just falls back to the default.<br/><br/>
